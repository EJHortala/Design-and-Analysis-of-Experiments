## The experiment
The **current** version of a software used for simulating certain electromagnetic characteristics of a patch antenna is known, based on extensive past experience, to have a mean simulation time of $\mu = 55s$ seconds and a variance $\sigma^2 = 100s^2$.

A **new** version of this software is developed, and we wish to investigate whether it results in _performance gains_ when compared to the currently available version. To investigate this particular question, $16$ simulations of small variations of the patch antenna geometry are executed, and their times are recorded as (see file `CS01_data.csv`, available on ):

```{r, echo = FALSE}
x <- read.table("CS01_data.csv", header = TRUE)
print(x)
```

For this experiment in particular, we are interested in investigating possible gains both in terms of _mean run time_ and of the _variance of run times_.

## Activities  
### For the test on the mean runtime:  
For this test, assume a desired significance level $\alpha = 0.01$. The teams must perform the following activities:

- Define the statistical hypotheses to be tested (null/alternative).
- Discuss and define the other experimental parameters of the test (smallest effect of practical relevance, desired power, _etc._). This is specific for each team, but must be determined based on discussions, related to the topic of the experiment.
- Test the hypotheses and decide for rejecting (or not) the null hypothesis.
- Calculate the confidence interval on the mean runtime.
- Validate and discuss the assumptions of the test.
- Discuss the power of the test (if needed), and the adequacy of the available sample size for this particular test.

### For the test on the standard deviation:  
For this test, assume a desired significance level $\alpha = 0.05$. The teams must perform the following activities:

- Define the statistical hypotheses to be tested (null/alternative).
- Test the hypotheses and decide for rejecting (or not) the null hypothesis.
- Calculate the confidence interval on the variance of the runtime.
- Validate and discuss the assumptions of the test.


After performing the activities related to each test individually, the team must:

- Draw conclusions and provide recommendations regarding the adoption (or not) of the new software version.
- Discuss possible ways to improve this experiment.

## Report  
Each team must prepare a short report detailing the experiment and the analysis performed. The report will be evaluated according to the following criteria:

- Use of the predefined format (see below);
- Reproducibility of the analyses;
- Technical quality;
- Logical structure;
- Correct use of language (grammar, orthography, _etc._);

The report must **necessarily** be prepared using [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com), and must contain the full code needed to reproduce the analysis performed by the team, embedded in the form of _code blocks_. Each team must deliver the following files:

- The report file, compiled in **.pdf** .
- The original (source) of the report, in **.Rmd**.

the **.Rmd** file must be able to be recompiled, if needed (tip: save your **.Rmd** file using UTF-8 encoding, to prevent compilation problems in other operational systems. 

Report templates are available on  [https://git.io/vHk0F](https://git.io/vHk0F), and an example of report structure can be consulted on [https://git.io/vHk0j](https://git.io/vHk0j). 

**Important**: Please include in the report the roles of each team member (Coordinator, Recorder, Checker and, for 4-member teams, Monitor)

**Important**: Reports can be prepared in either Portuguese or English.

***

## Deadline  
The report files (pdf + rmd) must be compressed into a single file and uploaded to the activity **Case Study 01** on Moodle, until **Monday, April 30th 2018, 11:59p.m.**. After that deadline the system will be closed. 

**Important**: Reports will NOT be received by e-mail or in printed form.
