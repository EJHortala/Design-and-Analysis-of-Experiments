## Lecture Notes on Design and Analysis of Experiments  
### **Prof. Felipe Campelo, Ph.D.**  

Here are my Lecture Notes on Design & Analysis of Experiments. Originally developed for my course in the Graduate Program in Electrical Engineering, I hope they might be useful elsewhere.

I am releasing these lecture notes under a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0 license, which I believe is pretty open. If you want to use or modify this material, please do me a favor and cite the original source. I would also greatly appreciate if you let me know where you're using it - I take a small pride on these things ;-)  
For more details on the license, check [here](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).

The lectures are fully developed in Beamer, with R as the statistical software of choice. All example files and datasets will also be made available here.

Cheers,
