# Design and Analysis of Experiments
Here are my Lecture Notes on Design & Analysis of Experiments. Originally developed for my course in the Graduate Program in Electrical Engineering, I hope they might be useful elsewhere.

The lectures are fully developed in Beamer, with R as the statistical software of choice. All example files and datasets will also be made available here.

Cheers,  
Felipe
