List of things to include (possibly) in future versions of these lecture notes

- Code highlighting for the rcode environment:
      - package _fvrb-ex_
      - package _listings_
      
- Sample size formulas using noncentral t

- Chapter 9 - non Normal data
      - data transformations  
            - **essential**: Sample size and power calculations for log-transformed data
      - classical nonparametrical methods
      - bootstrap

- Chapter 6: sample size estimation as a function of Cohen's d coefficient (for when variance is too hard to estimate)
