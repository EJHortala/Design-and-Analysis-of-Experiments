{Comparison of two means}
{Paired design}
Suppose the following situation: a young researcher develops an optimization algorithm (A) for a given family of problems, and wants to compare its converegence speed against a method that represents the state-of-the-art (B).
\vone
The researcher implements both methods and, after adjusting their parameters in a balanced way, performs a battery of tests on 11 representative instances of the family of problems she is interested in.
\vone
The measurements are made under homogeneous conditions (same computer, same operational conditions, etc.) and in randomized order, trying to avoid the contamination of the results by spurious influences. 20 repeated runs are performed for each algorithm on each problem.
\end{ftst}

\begin{ftst}
{Comparison of two means}
{Paired design}
Some important questions worth considering:

\bitems What is the actual question of interest?
\spitem What is the \textit{population} for which that question is relevant?
\spitem What are the independent observations for that population?
\spitem What is the relevant sample size for the experiment?
\eitem
\end{ftst}

%=====

\begin{ftst}
{Comparison of two means}
{Paired design}
The \textit{variation among the test problems} is a source of a large spurious variation that can and must be controlled;
\vone
An elegant solution to eliminate the influence of this nuisance parameter is the \textit{pairing} of the measurements by problem:

\bitems Observations are considered in pairs (A, B) for each problem; 
\item Hypothesis testing is done on the sample of \textit{differences};
\eitem

Let $y_{1j}$ and $y_{2j}$, $(j=1,\ldots,n)$ denote paired observations of average time for the proposed method (1) and the standard one (2), for each problem $j$;
\vhalf 
The \textit{paired differences} of the observations are calculated as $d_j = y_{1j} - y_{2j}$.
